          <br>
          <p>
            <b> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, often referred to the "Missile Man of
            India"</b>, led an extraordinary life dedicated to science, education, and
            the betterment of his nation.<br />

            was a testament to the power of dreams and determination. Rising
            from humble beginnings, he dedicated himself to the field of
            aerospace engineering, eventually becoming the driving force behind
            India's missile and space programs. Throughout his illustrious
            career, he played a pivotal role in India's journey to becoming a
            nuclear-armed nation. Dr. Kalam's remarkable legacy is not just

            passing on July 27, 2015, in Shillong, leaving behind a nation
